# TODO

 * Check ALU with the decoding
 * Get a testing setup for the simulator
 * Get a testing setup for the hardware implementation
 * Rescue RISC-V test fromm my local copy of sodor in data/repositories
   * also test from https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes (same os the above?)
   * And the student project from CAE: where did he get the tests from?
 * maybe do also: RegInit(0.U.asTypeOf(new IF_ID))
 * unaligned access is not too hard with bytewise access
